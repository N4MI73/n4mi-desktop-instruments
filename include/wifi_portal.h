// N4MI Desktop Instrument Series - Propagation Monitor
// wifi_portal.h -- real captive-portal Wi-Fi setup
//
// Runs an open AP (WIFI_SETUP_AP_NAME, config.h), a DNS server that
// redirects every domain to the device's own IP (the standard captive-
// portal trick -- it's *why* phones auto-detect this as "needs sign
// in" and pop their browser automatically, not a hack specific to any
// one OS), and a small web server serving a network-scan-and-select
// form. All three are polled from loop() (see wifi_portal_process()),
// never blocking -- except the one deliberate exception described
// below.
//
// Deliberate design choice, decided with Dan: credential *validation*
// (the moment a submitted password is actually tried against the
// chosen network) is blocking, up to WIFI_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_MS. During
// that window the device's own screens and knob are unresponsive --
// judged an acceptable trade-off since attention is on the phone
// during that specific action, not the device, unlike every other
// blocking-avoidance decision made elsewhere in this project.
